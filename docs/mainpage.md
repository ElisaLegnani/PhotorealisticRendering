 \mainpage Photorealistic Rendering

 A simple raytracing library for generating photorealistic images written in C++.

 It is developed for the course <a href="https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2021/numerical-tecniques-photorealistic-image-generation">Numerical techniques for photorealistic image generation</a> held by professor <a href="https://github.com/ziotom78">Maurizio Tomasi</a> (University of Milan, AY2020-2021).

 ## Brief description

 The main functionality of the library is rendering photorealistic images from user instructions on an external input text file. The code features four different backwards raytracing algorithms (onoff, flat, pathtracer, pointlight tracer) and –at the moment– the scene elements are basic geometric shapes (spheres, planes, boxes). Setting material properties of the objects determines the interaction with light rays, while the observer point of view is represented by a camera with two different projections available (orthogonal and perspective). This library has another useful functionality that is converting HDR images to LDR ones. The format supported are respectively PFM and PNG/JPG.
